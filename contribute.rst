Provide Feedback
================

We could always use more voices and opinions in the discussions about SunPy and its development from both users and developers.
You may want to suggest a new feature or tell us about how something is not working how you would expect it to.
There are a number of ways to make your voice heard and we would love to hear from you.

We strongly recommend that your first port of call would be to our lovely `matrix channel`_.
Here you can get in easily get in touch with developers or users for questions or support!
This is the most lively part of the community!

If you prefer email:

-  `The general mailing list`_ is a great place to start. Here we answer questions about SunPy or send out major announcements.
-  If you have technical issue about the code or want advice on how to help SunPy, the `developer mailing list`_ is another good place.
   This is where you can find the nitty gritty nuts and bolts discussions about the SunPy codebase.

Report Bugs
===========

If you run into unexpected behavior or run into a bug we urge you to please report it.
All bugs are kept track of on our `issue tracker`_.
You can add a bug report there or if you are not sure itâ€™s a bug send a message on `Matrix`_ or an email to the `developer mailing list`_.
Ideally, we would like a short code example so we can run into the bug on our own machines.

Provide Code
============

If you are interested in contributing fixes, code or documentation to SunPy please checkout our :doc:`newcomers guide <./newcomers>`.
We also have a more in-depth `developer guide`_, if that explains several items in more detail.

SunPy uses a distributed version control system called `Git`_ and the code is hosted on `GitHub`_.
To get started, create an account `on github`_ and fork SunPy then submit your changes via a pull request.
If you are unfamiliar with `Git`_ and `GitHub <http://github.com>`__ our developer documentation provides a sample `workflow`_ but you can also find lots of `tutorials`_ online.
You can browse our `issue list`_ or our `wishlist`_ to find something that you can tackle.
We have a short guide on how to `contribute`_ back to the SunPy repository.
Please send a quick email to the dev list or stop by the chat room to let people know what you are planning on working on (see the :doc:`./help` section).

SunPy Enhancement Proposals (SEP)
=================================

If you have an idea for a major enhancement or a proposed change to SunPy please consider submitting an SEP.
This process is modeled after the `Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)`_ and provides a structured proposal for the SunPy community to evaluate your idea.
You can find the `template`_ and `more information`_ about SEPs in the appropriate `SunPy repository`_. SEPs are submitted as pull requests into that repository.
