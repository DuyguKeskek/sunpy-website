Documentation
=============

The SunPy `documentation`_ should be your first stop to get your question answered.
We strive to provide a rich and comprehensive set of docs.
The documentation is included in the code itself which you can access through `code reference`_ and we also have a number of `guides`_ which take you through specific topics.
If you do not find your answer there read on!

=========

You can stay up to date on the development of SunPy and interact with the community with these helpful resources.
Anyone can and is encouraged to get involved.
Many methods of interactions are available and listed here:

*  Read and subscribe to `The SunPy Blog`_.
*  Subscribe to the `SunPy Mailing List`_.
*  Join us on github and add a feature request or bug report to our `issue list`_.

*  Join us at one of our weekly meetings. Check out `our calendar`_ to find the next one.

We are looking forward to meeting you!
But please be aware that we have a `Code of Conduct`_, that sets out how everyone should and will behave with each other.

Mailing List
============

Sometimes the best way to get your question answered is just by asking someone.
SunPy has two mailing lists; a `general mailing list`_ for general issues and a `developer mailing list`_.
If you have a general question about how SunPy works use the main list.
The general mailing list is another way to get help with doing solar physics in Python.
If, on the other hand, you have a question about the inner workings of SunPy or how SunPy is organized or have a question about developing some new feature please use the developer mailing list.

.. _general mailing list: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sunpy
.. _developer mailing list: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sunpy-dev

Live Chat
=========

We have a `riot channel`_ that uses `Matrix`_ which will open directly in your browser, or use the embedded client below.
Please stop by and say hello!
You will find the many SunPy users and the developers within the channel.

If you are using IRC hosted on `freenode`_, then you can join the same channel (bridged into matrix) by joining the (#sunpy) channel on freenode.

.. _riot channel: https://riot.im/app/#/room/#sunpy-general:matrix.org
.. _Matrix: https://matrix.org/
.. _freenode: https://freenode.net/
